### 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer and Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in AI, computer vision, and time series forecasting. My journey spans research and industry roles, where I’ve developed scalable ML systems, automated data pipelines, and deployed intelligent applications on the cloud.

Currently, I work as a **Research Assistant** under Prof. André Bauer, benchmarking transformer models for time series tasks and optimizing performance for real-world forecasting.
